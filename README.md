# churn_modelling
Classification problem; the goal is finding the optimal method to classify whether the customer of a bank will churn.

This statistical analysis report focuses on the churn modeling dataset from Kaggle, which contains information of 10,000 customers and 14 variables related to their banking behavior. The research objectives include exploratory analysis, graphical representations, and predictive modeling techniques such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, LDA/QDA, KNN, and Poisson regression, along with the use of LASSO and PCA techniques for feature selection. The report also employs resampling techniques to balance binary variables for more accurate modeling.

After comparing the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, we found that the Naive Bayes classifier with kernel density estimation applied to the oversampled data produced the most accurate predictions. This approach utilizes the Bernoulli distribution to model binary predictor variables and kernel density estimation to model the conditional probability density functions of continuous predictor variables. By assuming conditional independence of the predictor variables given the class label, Naive Bayes with kernel density estimation is able to efficiently estimate the probabilities of each class label given the predictor variables. The oversampling technique was applied to balance the imbalanced dataset, and the use of Naive Bayes with kernel density estimation on the oversampled data resulted in the best classification performance.
